                                <h3>The Beatles' debut album</h3>
                                <p> March 22, 1963</p>
                                <p>The Beatles recorded 10 of the 14 songs on <i>Please Please Me</i> in just over 12 hours</p>
                                <p><i>Please Please Me</i> contains the most covers the Beatles' have ever done, including popular Motown songs like the Shirelles' "Boys" and Arthur Alexander's "Anna"</p>
                                <p>Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The dynamic duo would gain songwriting fame, branding themselves as <i>Lennon-McCartney</i> </p>
                                <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>"Twist and Shout", the last song recorded, had John Lennon singing lead vocals. However, Lennon suffered from a nasty cold, which made his voice hoarse and grainy. Even so, he produced a memorable vocal performance: a raucous, dynamic rocker </p>

                                <p>February 07, 1964</p>
                                <p>When Pan Am Flight 101, carrying the four 
                                Beatles, touched down in Queens, <em>Beatlemania</em> had officially begun. It was the Beatles' first time in America, launching an influx of British culture and music in American society. The Beatles' debut was the most-watched program in U.S. history, watched by 45% of the U.S. population</p>
                                
                                <p>Two days later, the Beatles performed live on the <em>Ed Sullivan Show,</em> which was watched by ~ 73 million Americans. When Ed Sullivan introduced the band, he was immediately drowned out by girls screaming in the audience. In many ways, the Beatles were the first international boy band </p>
                                <p>Four months later, the Beatles released their 3rd album, <em>A Hard Day's Night.</em> All 13 tracks were written by <em>Lennon-McCartney</em>, showcasing the rapid progression of their songwriting abilities </p>
