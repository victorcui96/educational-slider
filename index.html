                                <p> March 22, 1963</p>
                                <p>The Beatles recorded 10 of the 14 songs on <i>Please Please Me</i> in just over 12 hours</p>
                                <p><i>Please Please Me</i> contains the most covers the Beatles' have ever done, including popular Motown songs like the Shirelles' "Boys" and Arthur Alexander's "Anna"</p>
                                <p>Of the album's 14 songs, eight were written by John Lennon and Paul McCartney. The dynamic duo would gain songwriting fame, branding themselves as <i>Lennon-McCartney</i> </p>
                                <p><strong>Fun Fact: </strong>"Twist and Shout", the last song recorded, had John Lennon singing lead vocals. However, Lennon suffered from a nasty cold, which made his voice hoarse and grainy. Even so, he produced a memorable vocal performance: a raucous, dynamic rocker </p>

                                <p>February 07, 1964</p>
                                <p>When Pan Am Flight 101, carrying the four Beatles, touched down in Queens, <em>Beatlemania</em> had officially begun. It was the Beatles' first time in America, launching an influx of British culture and music in American society. The Beatles' debut was the most-watched program in U.S. history, watched by 45% of the U.S. population</p>
                                <p>Two days later, the Beatles performed live on the <em>Ed Sullivan Show,</em> which was watched by ~ 73 million Americans. When Ed Sullivan introduced the band, he was immediately drowned out by girls screaming in the audience. In many ways, the Beatles were the first international boy band </p>
                                <p>Four months later, the Beatles released their 3rd album, <em>A Hard Day's Night.</em> All 13 tracks were written by <em>Lennon-McCartney</em>, showcasing the rapid progression of their songwriting abilities </p>

                                <p><em>Rubber Soul</em> was the first time that the Beatles focused on creating an album as an artistic work. It incorporated elements of pop, soul, folk, and even indian music. George Harrison's sitar on <em>Norwegian Wood</em> was the first time the instrument was used in a pop song </p>
                                <p>The Beatles were introduced to drugs during the making of the album, so the first elements of psychedelism pops up in songs like <em>Nowhere Man</em> and <em>What Goes On.</em> Ringo said that experimentation on the album was heavily influenced by marijuana </p>
                                <p>The Beatles went from a clean-cut boy band mostly composing love songs directed at teenage girls to a grown-up band capable of writing philosophically-oriented songs like <em>Nowhere Man</em> and the wonderfully ethereal <em>In My Life</em></p>
                                <p>Produced George Martin described Rubber Soul as the first album to present a new, growing Beatles to the world</p>

                                <p><em>Revolver</em> was the album that <em>cemented</em> the Beatles' legacy. It marked a huge progression from the previous year's <em>Rubber Soul</em> in terms of style and experimentation</p>
                                <p>The album's sounds include tape loops and backwards recordings on <em>Tomorrow Never Knows</em>, a classical string octet on <em>Eleanor Rigby</em>, and Indian background music on <em>Love You To</em></p>
                                <p>The albums psychedelic sound was heavily influenced by the Beatles copious use of LSD during the recording of the album, a habit that band kept well-hidden from the public. John Lennon in particular became addicted to the drug. </em>

                                <p>George challenged the Lennon-McCartney songwriting dominance with three brilliant songs written by him, <em>Taxman</em>, <em>I Want to Tell You</em>, and <em>Love You To</em></p>

                                <p>Most of the songs on the <em>White Album</em> were written during March and April 1968 at a Transcendental Meditation course in Rishikesh, India. During recording sessions, arguments broke out among the Fab Four, among over both petty things and creative differences. </p>
                                <p>The arguments became so intense and frequent that Ringo left the band briefly in August 1968. The tensions proved to be ongoing: the breakup of the Beatles had begun</p>
                                <p>At the same time, the creative tension within the band resulted in one of the most adventurous and intense rock albums ever</p>
                                <p>Ringo Starr wrote his first original song on this album, the country-tinged <em>Don't Pass Me By</em></p>
                                <p>Fun Fact: <em>The White Album</em> is by far the longest Beatles album</p>
